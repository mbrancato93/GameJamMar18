# GameJamMar18
Project Files for Game Jam (March 18, 2022)

First ever game jam through https://minijamofficial.com/! Made using https://godotengine.org/

The jam's there was STEAM with a limitation that death was not the end. We chose to create a game which makes the player a water spirit, battling fire spirits in a 2d side scroller. If you get hit, never fear, there are condensors placed throughout to convert you from steam back to water.

Controls:
	-> WASD to move
	-> Pressing S on the ground will turn you into an ice block which is impervious to fire spirits
	-> Space shoots, two hits kill the fire spirits
	
Very fun project to work on and hopefully the beginning of a new hobby!
